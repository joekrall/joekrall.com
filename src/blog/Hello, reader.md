The idea of a blog as a "commonplace," to take a [phrase](https://web.archive.org/web/20111228170618/https://dgmyers.blogspot.com/2009/02/foxs-apology.html) from one of the first blogs I read, is one that's stuck with me. After two years of coding and writing for much longer, I've found that I have things I'd like to remember and things I'd like to share. 

There are some features I'd like to add: a changelog for posts and linked tagging come to mind. But that's what iterating is for.

As I worked on creating the initial version of this site, I owe thanks to a number of people:
- [Chris Krycho](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/), for practical advice about creating and maintaining an online presence (modeling iteration especially).
- [James Midzi](https://github.com/Psypher1/), for a very thorough [tutorial](https://dev.to/psypher1/series/18202) that helped me find the bones of this site.
- [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/about/), for permission to use aspects of his site's design. 
- [Evan Travers](https://evantravers.com/), for advice about deployment, pointing out [gotchas](https://evantravers.com/articles/2022/04/20/frustrated-with-11ty/), and general encouragement.

There are many other people I could thank, beyond the scope of acknowledging help received for this particular project. We make jokes about [dependencies](https://xkcd.com/2347/) in software, but dependencies of a deeper kind, along with gratitude and thanksgiving, mark a life. I'm glad to have built something, and I'm thankful you are reading this.
